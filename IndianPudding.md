I tried to make an Indian Pudding with my slow cooker by combining two recipes that I found online.

-   [Indian Pudding from the NY Times](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016896-indian-pudding)
-   [Simply Recipes.com](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/indian_pudding/)

# Ingredients<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

-   4 c. Milk
-   1 c. corn meal
-   1/2 c. molasses
-   4 eggs
-   1/2 c. brown sugar
-   1 tsp. nutmeg
-   1/2 tsp. cinnamon
-   1/2 tsp. ginger
-   1/2 c. water

Heat milk so that it is hot, but not boiling.  Then whisk in the cornmeal and molasses and cook 2 minutes.  Reduce the heat.

Beat the eggs and mix in 1/2 c. of the hot cornmeal mixture.  Pour the egg mixture into the pan and whisk it constantly.  Cook it for 3 minutes.

Stir in the spices and pour into the slow cooker dish.  Pour in the water and mix it thoroughly.  Then set the slow cooker on low and let it simmer.
