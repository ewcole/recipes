Heat milk so that it is hot, but not boiling.  Then whisk in the cornmeal and molasses and cook 2 minutes.  Reduce the heat.

Beat the eggs and mix in 1/2 c. of the hot cornmeal mixture.  Pour the egg mixture into the pan and whisk it constantly.  Cook it for 3 minutes.

Stir in the spices and pour into the slow cooker dish.  Pour in the water and mix it thoroughly.  Then set the slow cooker on low and let it simmer.
